**Project Title**:

Predicting Student Scores based on Study Hours: A Linear Regression Approach

**Description**:

This project aims to predict the percentage of students based on the number of study hours using a linear regression model. It utilizes a dataset that includes the number of study hours and corresponding scores achieved by students. The linear regression model is trained on this data to establish a relationship between study hours and scores, allowing for score prediction for new input data.

**Features**

Linear regression model implementation
Prediction of student scores based on study hours
Calculation of performance metrics (RMSE, R2 score)
Visual representation of the model's fit
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains pairs of study hours and scores achieved by students. The data is represented in a tabular format with two columns: Hours and Scores.

**Requirements**

Python (version 3.10.12)

Pandas

scikit-learn 

matplotlib 

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of student study hours and their corresponding scores. It contains 25 samples with two columns: 'Hours' (study hours) and 'Scores' (student scores).

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the linear regression model is evaluated using two metrics:
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): The RMSE measures the average distance between the predicted scores and the actual scores. Lower values indicate better accuracy.
- R2 Score: The R2 score represents the proportion of variance in the scores that can be explained by the study hours. Higher values indicate a better fit.


## Results and Discussion
The linear regression model achieved an RMSE of 4.647 and an R2 score of 0.945. This indicates a good fit of the model to the data, with the study hours explaining approximately 94.5% of the variance in the student scores.

Further analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between study hours and scores. However, it's important to note that the model's predictions may have limitations and additional factors beyond study hours could influence student performance.
